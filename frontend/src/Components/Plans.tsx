                                    Intermittent fasting (IF) is a pattern of eating that involves regular short-term fasts and consuming meals within a shorter time period during the day.

                                    The human gut hosts a vast number and variety of microorganisms, including around 37 trillion bacteria

                                <p>
                                    Every individual has different varieties and amounts of bacteria in their gut. Some types can increase the amount of energy the person harvests from food, leading to fat deposition and weight gain

People should try to ensure that vegetables and other plant-based foods comprise 75 percent of their meal

Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, yogurt, tempeh, and miso all contain good amounts of probiotics, which help to increase good bacteria. Researchers have studied kimchi widely, and study results suggest that it has anti-obesity effects. Similarly, studies have shown that kefir may help to promote weight loss in overweight women.

                                    Mindful eating is a practice where people pay attention to how and where they eat food. This practice can enable people to enjoy the food they eat and maintain a healthy weight

                                    As most people lead busy lives, they often tend to eat quickly on the run, in the car, working at their desks, and watching TV. As a result, many people are barely aware of the food they are eating.

                                        Sitting down to eat, preferably at a table: Pay attention to the food and enjoy the experience.

                                    <li>
                                        Avoiding distractions while eating: Do not turn on the TV, or a laptop or phone.

                                        Eating slowly: Take time to chew and savor the food. This technique helps with weight loss, as it gives a person’s brain enough time to recognize the signals that they are full, which can help to prevent over-eating.

                                In all cases, the weight must be heavy enough that performing much more than 20 reps is impossible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The weight you choose to use should leave you at or near failure on your specified number of repetitions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, if you’re performing a set of 10 repetitions, by the tenth repetition, you should be unable or nearly unable to perform another repetition. You should rarely have more than “two reps in the tank” by the end of a set if your goal is building muscle
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The overall implication of the repetition range continuum is that you should go through different phases of training using different repetition ranges to see what gives your body the most muscle growth.

                    4. Structure your workout to avoid overtraining
                </h2>
                <div className="w-full flex flex-row">
                    <div className="w-full flex flex-row">

                        </div>
                        <div className="w-full text-left p-8">

                                A good rule of thumb is to perform 3 sets of 3–5 compound movements, followed by 3 sets of 1–2 isolation movements per workout.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Generally, you do your heaviest sets using compound movements and perform higher repetition ranges on your isolation movements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Assuming you’re performing three working sets per exercise, limit your total combined compound and isolation movement exercises to 5–7 movements per workout.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This allows you to benefit from each type of exercise while maximizing the overall muscle building potential of your training program and avoiding any symtems of overtraining

                    3. Choose your exercises well

                    <div className="w-full flex flex-row-reverse">

                        </div>
                        <div className="w-full text-left p-8">

                                As mentioned, muscle building is specific to the muscle being worked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, to build bigger biceps, you need to perform exercises that work the biceps. This could be an isolated bicep exercise, such as a bicep curl, or a compound movement that uses the biceps, such as a pullup.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In terms of the best exercise type for muscle building, compound and isolation movements can be equally effective at causing muscle hypertrophy
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, isolation movements are typically easier to perform when you’re fatigued, as you’re not stabilizing your entire body. This may allow you a few extra targeted sets at the end of a workout when you’re otherwise too exhausted to do another compound exercise.
                            </p>
